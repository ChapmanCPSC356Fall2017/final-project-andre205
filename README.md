#### This app stores a list of user-generated bike routes and displays them to the user in a recyclerview
#### The list is stored in a sqlite database allowing it to persist when the app is closed
#### Routes can be added, edited, and deleted from the route view (or from swiping it away in the list view)
#### The list can be reordered by tapping and holding on an element and dragging it to the desired position
